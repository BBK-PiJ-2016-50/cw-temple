   * Explore the cavern, trying to find the orb in as few steps as possible.

   * it up. If you continue to move after finding the orb rather
   * than returning, it will not count.
   * If you return from this function while not standing on top of the orb,
   * it will count as a failure.
   *   
   * <p>There is no limit to how many steps you can take, but you will receive
   * a score bonus multiplier for finding the orb in fewer steps.</p>
   * 
   * <p>At every step, you only know your current tile's ID and the ID of all
   * open neighbor tiles, as well as the distance to the orb at each of these tiles
   * (ignoring walls and obstacles).</p>
   * 
   * <p>To get information about the current state, use functions
   * getCurrentLocation(),
   * getNeighbours(), and
   * getDistanceToTarget()
   * in ExplorationState.
   * You know you are standing on the orb when getDistanceToTarget() is 0.</p>
   *
   * <p>Use function moveTo(long id) in ExplorationState to move to a neighboring
   * tile by its ID. Doing this will change state to reflect your new position.</p>
   *
   * <p>A suggested first implementation that will always find the orb, but likely won't
   * receive a large bonus multiplier, is a depth-first search.</p>
